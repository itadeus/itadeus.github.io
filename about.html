        "Tadeus Kalola"
        <br><br>
        I am currently occupied in Customer Relations Management at MTC, bringing over 12 years of experience in customer service. 
        My journey has allowed me to develop strong communication, problem-solving, and people skills.
        <br>
        I am studying towards an Informatics degree at NUST, with the goal of blending customer-centric skills with technological expertise.
        My aspiration is to transition into the tech industry and become a software/web developer within the next 5 years. 
        I want to build innovative and meaningful applications that make a real difference in society.
        <br>
        Beyond technology, I enjoy music and soccer in my free time. I also love traveling, as it allows me to learn from diverse cultures and broaden my knowledge base.
        I believe that continuous learning and persistence are the keys to unlocking opportunities. 
        Every challenge I face is a stepping stone toward achieving my vision of becoming a skilled software developer.
        <br>
        My passion lies in web development and creating meaningful digital experiences.
